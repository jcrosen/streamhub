# streamhub

A data-agnostic streaming-via-websockets service

## Installation

* Install docker and docker-compose
* Clone the repo
* `docker-compose build`

## Usage

* `docker-compose up -d`

## Options

**_TBD_**

### Bugs

Uh, lots, this isn't even alpha software...

## Special Notes
* This is built on lots of existing tools without which my idea would never have taken shape; thank you to every maintainer of every dependency in this project's configuration!
* I'm a novice clojure programer, so this is probably full of bad ideas and crummy code; read at your own peril (and feel free to drop me a line if you have any feedback)!
